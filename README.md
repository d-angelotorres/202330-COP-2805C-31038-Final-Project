This project is a client-server application that calculates Fibonacci numbers. The application consists of two main components: a server that performs the Fibonacci calculation and a client that sends a number to the server and displays the result.

Key Concepts and Tools:
Socket Programming: The client and server communicate using TCP sockets, which is a fundamental concept in network programming.
Multithreading: The server handles multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
GUI (Graphical User Interface): The client application features a simple graphical user interface built with Swing, allowing users to input a number and see the calculated Fibonacci result.

Expected Inputs and Outputs:
Input: The user inputs a positive integer into the client application.
Output: The server computes the corresponding Fibonacci number, which is then displayed on the client's GUI.
